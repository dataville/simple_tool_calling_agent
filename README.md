# 🤖 AI Agent with Tool-Calling - LangChain & LangGraph Tutorial

**A complete educational implementation of an autonomous AI agent that can intelligently decide when and how to use external tools, built with LangChain and LangGraph.**

## 🎯 What This Is

A hands-on Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a real AI agent (not just a chatbot) that can:
- ✅ Autonomously decide when to use tools vs. respond directly
- ✅ Execute external functions with proper parameters
- ✅ Chain multiple tool calls to solve complex problems
- ✅ Maintain conversation state and context

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **LangChain** - Tool abstraction and LLM integration
- **LangGraph** - Workflow orchestration and state management  
- **vLLM** - Local model serving (Mistral-7B-Instruct)
- **Python 3.8+** - Core implementation


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- vLLM server running locally (or modify to use OpenAI API)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab


## 🔄 From Tutorial to Production

This notebook provides the foundation for building sophisticated agents that can interact with:
- 🌐 External APIs and web services
- 🗄️ Databases and data warehouses
- 📊 Analytics and visualization tools
- 🔧 DevOps and automation systems
