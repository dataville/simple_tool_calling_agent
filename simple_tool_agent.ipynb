    "## How the Agent Uses This Tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User asks: \"What's the weather in Boston?\"\n",

    "# 🚀 Next Steps: From Mock to Production\n",
    "Now that you understand the fundamentals of tool-calling agents, here's how to evolve this into a production-ready system:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Immediate Enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace Mock Tools with Real APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Integrate actual weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Weather.gov)\n",
    "    * Add error handling for API failures and rate limits\n",
    "    * Implement retry logic and fallback strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Expand the Toolset\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Add complementary tools (forecast, weather alerts, historical weather)\n",
    "    * Create tools for different domains (news, calculations, web search)\n",
    "    * Build tool chains where one tool's output feeds into another\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enhance Agent Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Add memory/context persistence across conversations\n",
    "    * Implement planning capabilities for multi-step problems\n",
    "    * Fine-tune prompts for better tool selection decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool Validation: Add parameter validation before tool execution\n",
    "* Parallel Execution: Configure the agent to call multiple tools simultaneously\n",
    "* Observability: Add logging and monitoring to track tool usage and performance\n",
    "* Human-in-the-Loop: Build approval workflows for sensitive tool operations"
