    "# Tool-Calling Agent with Hybrid Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a complete tool-calling AI agent system built with LangChain and LangGraph. The agent can execute function calls (weather queries, calculations) and includes semantic evaluation of its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses **one LLM instance** (Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B via vLLM) serving two distinct roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Mode**: LLM with tools bound (`llm_with_tools`) - makes structured tool calls\n",
    "- **Evaluator Mode**: Raw LLM without tools (`llm`) - performs semantic assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach addresses GPU memory constraints while maintaining proper separation between agent execution and evaluation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Tool Calling**: Agent makes actual function calls rather than describing tool usage in text\n",
    "- **Smart Routing**: Uses LangGraph to manage agent flow and decide when to call tools vs. return final answers\n",
    "- **Semantic Evaluation**: LLM-based assessment of tool selection correctness and response quality, avoiding brittle keyword matching\n",
    "- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas ensure proper tool parameter handling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- vLLM server running Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B on port 8082\n",
    "- Function-calling capable model (general instruction models lack this capability)"

    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Before running this notebook, start the vLLM server in a separate terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vllm serve NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B \\\n",

    "## Pydantic Models for Tool Input Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic models define the expected input schema for each tool, ensuring the LLM generates valid, structured tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Requirement: Function-Calling Capable Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not all LLMs support Pydantic-based tool calling.** The model must be specifically trained for structured function calling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Before selecting an LLM**, verify it explicitly supports function calling with structured schemas. Using a model without this capability will result in the agent describing tool usage in text rather than making actual structured tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Pydantic?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Enforces correct data types (str, float, int, etc.)\n",
    "- **Validation**: Applies constraints (min/max length, numerical ranges)\n",
    "- **Schema Generation**: Automatically creates JSON schemas that the LLM uses to structure tool calls\n",
    "- **Field Descriptions**: Provides detailed parameter descriptions that guide the LLM's tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool follows this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass with typed fields\n",
    "2. Use `Field()` to add descriptions and validation constraints\n",
    "3. Pass the model to `@tool(args_schema=ModelClass)` decorator\n",
    "4. Write the function with a complete docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "The field descriptions are critical—they're sent to the LLM and directly influence how it constructs tool calls."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Define Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are Python functions that the agent can call to perform specific tasks. The LLM must understand what each tool does and when to use it based solely on the tool's metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection for Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical requirement**: You must use a model specifically trained for function calling. Not all LLMs support structured tool calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens with the wrong model**: The agent will generate text descriptions like \"I would call the weather tool for Boston\" instead of making actual structured function calls. Always verify function-calling support before implementing your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Role of Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstrings are not optional**—they are the primary mechanism by which the LLM learns what each tool does. The docstring content is sent to the LLM as part of the tool schema. Many coding agents will skip the docstring or provide a minimal tool description that is not adequate for an agent to utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes an effective tool docstring:**\n",
    "- **Clear purpose statement**: First line explains what the tool does\n",
    "- **Detailed parameter descriptions**: Each argument needs explanation and examples\n",
    "- **Return value documentation**: Describes what the tool outputs\n",
    "- **Format and constraints**: Any limitations or expected formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM reads these docstrings to decide:\n",
    "1. Which tool (if any) to call for a given query\n",
    "2. What arguments to pass to the tool\n",
    "3. How to interpret the tool's output\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor or missing docstrings lead to incorrect tool selection and malformed tool calls. The quality of your docstrings directly determines agent reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool combines four components:\n",
    "1. **Pydantic model** (`args_schema`) - validates inputs\n",
    "2. **@tool decorator** - registers the function as a callable tool\n",
    "3. **Docstring** - instructs the LLM on tool usage\n",

    "## Bind Tools to Create Agent LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a critical step that many coding agents incorrectly skip.** Simply defining tools is not enough—they must be explicitly bound to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Tool Binding Does\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm.bind_tools(tools)` creates a **new LLM instance** (`llm_with_tools`) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Receives tool schemas**: The Pydantic models and docstrings are converted to JSON schemas and sent with every request\n",
    "2. **Enables structured output**: The LLM is configured to return tool calls as structured data (function name + arguments) rather than text descriptions\n",
    "3. **Maintains the original**: The base `llm` remains unchanged and available for non-tool tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Step is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without binding:**\n",
    "- The LLM has no knowledge of available tools\n",
    "- Responses will be text descriptions like \"I would call the weather tool...\" instead of actual function calls\n",
    "- The agent cannot execute any tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**With binding:**\n",
    "- The LLM receives tool metadata with every prompt\n",
    "- It can generate properly structured tool calls: `{\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"args\": {\"location\": \"Boston\"}}`\n",
    "- The agent can execute the structured calls and return real results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two LLM Instances in This System\n",
    "\n",
    "- `llm`: Base model without tools (used for evaluation)\n",
    "- `llm_with_tools`: Agent model with tools bound (used for agent responses)\n",

    "## Hybrid Evaluator Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluator uses **the same LLM instance** for assessment but without tools bound, implementing a \"hybrid\" approach that addresses GPU memory constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"Hybrid\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"hybrid\" refers to using one physical model instance in two different modes:\n",
    "- **Agent mode**: `llm_with_tools` (with tool schemas)\n",
    "- **Evaluator mode**: `llm` (raw model, no tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows semantic evaluation without requiring a second model to be loaded into GPU memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than brittle keyword matching (e.g., checking if response contains \"multiply\"), the evaluator uses the LLM's semantic understanding to assess:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Selection Correctness**: Did the agent choose appropriate tools for the query?\n",
    "2. **Response Quality**: Is the final answer clear, complete, and well-formatted?\n",
    "3. **Overall Success**: Does the response successfully address the user's question?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The `evaluate_response` function:\n",
    "- Constructs a structured evaluation prompt with available tools, tools used, and final answer\n",
    "- Invokes the **raw LLM** (without tool bindings) to perform assessment\n",
    "- Parses the LLM's evaluation into structured fields\n",
    "- Returns a dictionary with ratings and reasoning for each criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides nuanced evaluation that understands semantic variations (e.g., \"multiplied\" vs \"multiply\" vs \"times\") without fragile string matching."
